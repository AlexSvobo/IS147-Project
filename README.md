**Example Scenario:**

Debts enrolled are typically settled for 50% or less of the original balance, with a fee of 25% of the original balance for arranging settlements. This incentivizes the settlement team to obtain low settlement amounts. For instance, a client with $10,000 of debt may end up paying $7,500 over 30 months at $250/month, which is typically less than their monthly minimum payments.

---

**Common Criteria:**

- Greater than $10,000 in unsecured debts.
- Monthly draft amount is no less than $250.00 per month.
