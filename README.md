Debt settlement is a hardship-based debt relief program whereas individuals will enroll their unsecured debts such as credit cards, medical bills, and unsecured loans in order to have someone negotiate with their creditors on their behalf. The goal of debt settlement is to obtain a payoff amount, and schedule, that is favorable for the client. Overall, debt settlement seeks to provide a way for individuals affected by financial hardship to pay back their debts in a reasonable manner without being penalized with fees and interest for too long.
