Debt settlement is a hardship-based debt relief program whereas individuals will enroll their unsecured debts such as credit cards, medical bills, and unsecured loans in order to have someone negotiate with their creditors on their behalf. The goal of debt settlement is to obtain a payoff amount, and schedule, that is favorable for the client. Overall, debt settlement seeks to provide a way for individuals affected by financial hardship to pay back their debts in a reasonable manner without being penalized with fees and interest for too long.


This program should be able to obtain client and creditor information via console inputs. Then, qualify or decline the client based on the information provided and the common criteria found within the debt settlement industry today. Once qualified, this program will also have a fake, but realistic prior-settlement array or database, so that we can provide qualified leads with an estimated settlement amount "based on prior performance." This program will also be able to provide the required monthly draft amount pertaining to their estimate. 

Additional pieces of debt settlement will included as needed to ensure project requirements are fulfilled.

EXAMPLE: Debts enrolled will typically be settled for 50% or less of the original balance enrolled. The fee for arranging the settlement is 25% of the original balance enrolled. This encourages the settlement team to obtain the lowest settlement amounts possible. Overall, some enrolling $10,000 of debt should end the program paying $7500. Program lengths are typically no longer than 48 months and monthly deposits are no less than $250/month. With this type of program, the $10,000 client will be debt free in 30 months at $250/month -- an amount that is also typically less than their monthly minimum payments. 

Common Critera:
Over $10,000 in unsecured debts
