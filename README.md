**Overview:**

Debt settlement is a hardship-based debt relief program where individuals enroll their unsecured debts (e.g., credit cards, medical bills, unsecured loans) to negotiate with creditors for favorable payoff terms. The goal is to help individuals affected by financial hardship pay back debts without excessive fees and interest.

---

**Functionality:**

This program collects client and creditor information through console inputs. It then qualifies or declines clients based on industry-standard criteria. Once qualified, the program provides a fake, but realistic prior-settlement array or database to estimate settlement amounts "based on prior performance." It also calculates the required monthly draft amount related to the estimate.

---

**Example Scenario:**

Debts enrolled are typically settled for 50% or less of the original balance, with a fee of 25% of the original balance for arranging settlements. This incentivizes the settlement team to obtain low settlement amounts. For instance, a client with $10,000 of debt may end up paying $7,500 over 30 months at $250/month, which is typically less than their monthly minimum payments.

**Common Criteria:**

- Over $10,000 in unsecured debts
